/**
 * 621. Task Scheduler

 *
 * Hint
 * You are given an array of CPU tasks, each represented by letters A to Z, and a cooling time, n. Each cycle or interval allows the completion of one task. Tasks can be completed in any order, but there's a constraint: identical tasks must be separated by at least n intervals due to cooling time.
 *
 * â€‹Return the minimum number of intervals required to complete all tasks.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A","B","B","B"], n = 2
 *
 * Output: 8
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> A -> B.
 *
 * After completing task A, you must wait two cycles before doing A again. The same applies to task B. In the 3rd interval, neither A nor B can be done, so you idle. By the 4th cycle, you can do A again as 2 intervals have passed.
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","C","A","B","D","B"], n = 1
 *
 * Output: 6
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> C -> D -> A -> B.
 *
 * With a cooling interval of 1, you can repeat a task after just one other task.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: tasks = ["A","A","A", "B","B","B"], n = 3
 *
 * Output: 10
 *
 * Explanation: A possible sequence is: A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B -> idle -> idle -> A -> B.
 *
 * There are only two types of tasks, A and B, which need to be separated by 3 intervals. This leads to idling twice between repetitions of these tasks.
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 * 1 <= tasks.length <= 10^4
 * tasks[i] is an uppercase English letter.
 * 0 <= n <= 100
